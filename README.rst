=========


**AbsorpFit** is a small Python package that provides utilities for analyzing patterns and structures in 2D and 3D datasets.

**AbsorpFit** is a standalone notebook that you can just download and use with your own data. It requires the packages numpy, matplotlib, scipy, astropy, and pandas.

**AbsorpFit** was first used in the following papers:

- `Neutral gas properties of Lyman continuum emitting galaxies: Column densities and covering fractions from UV absorption lines <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...616A..29G/abstract>`_ 
- `The origin of the escape of Lyman Î± and ionizing photons in Lyman continuum emitters <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...639A..85G/abstract>`_

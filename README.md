AbsorpFit
=========


**AbsorpFit** is a small Python package that provides utilities for analyzing patterns and structures in 2D and 3D datasets.

There is no need to install anything, you can just download the repository and use the jupyter notebook with your own data.

**AbsorpFit** was first used in the following papers:

- `Neutral gas properties of Lyman continuum emitting galaxies: Column densities and covering fractions from UV absorption lines <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...616A..29G/abstract>`_ 
- `The origin of the escape of Lyman Î± and ionizing photons in Lyman continuum emitters <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...639A..85G/abstract>`_
